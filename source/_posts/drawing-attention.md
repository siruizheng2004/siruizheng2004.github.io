# Drawing – "Attention is All You Need"

I have been learning drawing since I was eight years old. Even though my schedule became very busy after high school, I never gave up drawing and still practice whenever I have free time. I can spend up to eight hours continuously on a single drawing, only taking short breaks for water or the restroom, driven by the anticipation of seeing the final result. This dedication has helped me develop remarkable focus and attention to detail.

*Each piece reflects hours of focus and attention to detail, a practice that has shaped both my art and my approach to learning.*
