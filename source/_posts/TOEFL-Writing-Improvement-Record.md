## Background

My overall TOEFL score ranged from **87 to 96**, with section scores of **26 (Reading), 24 (Listening), 22 (Speaking), and 24 (Writing)**.  
Among these, writing was clearly my weakest section in an earlier attempt, scoring only **18 out of 30**.

The image above shows the score report from my recent TOEFL attempt, reflecting a modest but meaningful improvement in the writing section.

## Writing Practice Strategy

To address this weakness, I set a realistic goal of completing **one writing practice per day**, focusing either on the **Integrated Writing task** or the **Academic Discussion task**. Due to limited preparation time, I did not aim for a dramatic score increase. Instead, I focused on improving my **basic writing ability**, particularly in vocabulary usage, grammatical accuracy, and reducing typographical errors.

One important adjustment was deliberately **avoiding overly complex sentence structures**. In previous attempts, trying to write sophisticated sentences often resulted in grammatical mistakes. This time, I prioritized **clarity and correctness**, which helped me write more consistently.

## Reflections

With repeated practice, the Integrated Writing task became more manageable. Familiarity with the task allowed me to apply a clear and stable structure without spending excessive time deciding how to organize the essay. This left more time to focus on content accuracy and logical flow.

Overall, while the improvement was incremental, the process helped me build a more solid foundation in academic writing and gain a clearer understanding of what is realistically achievable within a limited timeframe.
